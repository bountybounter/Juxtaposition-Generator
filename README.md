# Juxtaposition Generator

Web application written in Python and JavaScript that generates combinations of comments from an adult video website and inspirational wallpapers from reddit.com. 


## Installation

Download the package as a zip or clone, then run the npm install 

* 'npm install'

If you don't have npm and/or node, follow the directions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). 

## Usage

Once node and npm are installed along with the dependencies covered in the step above, run: 

* 'node app.js' 

Then point your browser to [localhost port 3456](http://localhost:3456) and the app should be working. Initial startup is slow due to the python web scraping.
